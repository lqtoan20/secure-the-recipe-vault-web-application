# Poor practice 1
For the VPC configuration, all the route definitions have DestinationCidrBlock defined as 0.0.0.0/0.
In case there is a breach into the resource in the subnet configured within this routing table,
attacker has an option to transfer information to any IP address within VPC or outside of it.

# Poor practice 2
IAM Role has full access to any s3 bucket instance. This behavior make Violation of the
least privilege principle. This role should only have access to specific buckets and allow only necessary actions.
Allowing full access would expose a vulnarability to change content in any S3 bucket of AWS account

# Poor practice 3
Based on a EC2 instance in diagram provider, IAM Role (InstanceRole) is assigned
to both WebServiceInstance and AttackInstanceSG instance. Again, This behavior make Violation of the
least privilege principle, the access to s3 bucket resources for
these two instances has to specified by a separate roles with appropriate permissions needed for
specific buckets
